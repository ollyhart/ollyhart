You're his cook now. You're the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab without me and now that cook has reason to kill me. Think about it! It's brilliant. So go ahead. If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead. Put a bullet, in my head, and kill me right now. DO IT! Do it. Do it. Do it. 

Saul, Saul... this man that we spoke of before, this... this person that you said could... could disappear me, get me a whole new life and make sure that I'm never found. Yeah I need him, Saul. Gus is gonna murder my whole family. I need this man now. Saul... now, Saul!
